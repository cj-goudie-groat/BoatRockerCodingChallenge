# BoatRockerCodingChallenge

Assumptions: 
  The program is case insensitive
  It can be ran on an html site using text boxes 
  Any libraries I deemed useful were fair game (JQuery)
  I did not have to write unit tests for it
Dependencies:
  None

The program took me approximately 6 hours over the course of a few days. A large part of this was learning how the pokeapi worked, as I had never used it prior to this.
